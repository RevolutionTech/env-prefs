Environment Preferences
==========
This is a place where I keep bash aliases, custom functions, and other preferences so that I can easily use keep them up-to-date across different environments.

---

To add the aliases and custom functions, add the following to your shell startup file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.profile`, etc.):

`source ~/env-prefs/.bash_alias`

Then source the shell startup file:

`source ~/.bashrc`

---

To add custom Sublime settings, first navigate to the directory where `Preferences.sublime-settings` is stored. On a Mac, it might be:

`cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/`

Then remove and symlink the settings file:

`rm ./Preferences.sublime-settings`

`ln -s ~/env-prefs/Sublime\ Text/Preferences.sublime-settings ./Preferences.sublime-settings`

---

Feel free to contribute by adding your own helpful aliases and custom functions that others may find useful. Please note that I use this repo in conjunction with other private repos so that aliases or configurations that are strictly used in specific environments are not included here.
