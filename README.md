# Environment Preferences

This is a place where I keep bash aliases, custom functions, and other preferences so that I can easily use keep them up-to-date across different environments.

To get started, begin by cloning this repo:

`cd ~/; git clone https://github.com/RevolutionTech/env-prefs.git`

---

To add the aliases and custom functions, add the following to your shell startup file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.profile`, etc.):

`source ~/env-prefs/.bash_alias`

Then source the shell startup file:

`source ~/.bashrc`

Feel free to contribute by adding your own helpful aliases and custom functions that others may find useful. Please note that I use this repo in conjunction with other private repos so that aliases or configurations that are strictly used in specific environments are not included here.
